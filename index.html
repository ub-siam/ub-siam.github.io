                    Welcome to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
                    Chapter at the University at Buffalo.  SIAM is an academic association
                    dedicated to the use of mathematics in industry. SIAM is the world's largest
                    professional association devoted to applied mathematics, and roughly two-thirds 
                    of its membership resides within the United States.<br><br>

                    The SIAM Chapter is a newly formed student organization. The Chapter was
                    activated in September 2021, and it consists of faculty advisors, officers, and
                    members. Its purpose is to contribute toward the development of applied
                    mathematics at the University at Buffalo, create a community which serves in
                    applied mathematics, and provide its student members a means for
                    professional development.<br><br>

                    Leading this chapter is a committee formed of graduate students and Ph.D candidates.  
                    Collaborating with members and faculty, our goal as committee is to design activities, events,
                    and projects which address the purpose of the chapter.  The current committee as of Fall 2022 
                    for this chapter is the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sayantan Sarkar, President</li>
                        <li>Saiful Islam, Vice President</li>
                        <li>Jeremy Kazimer, Secretary</li>
                        <li>Jnanajyoti Bhaumik, Treasurer</li>
                    </ul>

                    More information about these wonderful people and those previously on the committee 
                    <a href="eboard.html">can be found on this webpage.</a>

                    <!-- <b style = "color:red">
                        Here, we could put pictures the 4 current eboard 
                        (Katerina, Asela, Madison, Jeremy) and our advisor.
                        Maybe, clicking on the pictures brings them to a new page
                        where we can write bios about ourselves and link to stuff like
                        Google Scholar, LinkedIn, etc.  We can do this for previous eboard 
                        as well.

                    Our Chapter organizes events such as social gatherings, presentations, and
                    conferences in order to further its aforementioned goals.
                    Some event examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meet and Greet Event, October 2021</li>
                        <li>Women in STEM (cohosted with AWM), March 2022</li>
                        <li>Applied Math Workshop, April 2022</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    For more information on these events and others, including pictures,  
                    <a href="events.html">please view the following webpage.</a>
                    <!-- In October of 2021, we had a
                    “meet and greet” event where the new members of the Chapter had the
                    opportunity to meet the faculty advisor and the officers and discuss with them
                    about the Chapter and its future events.<br><br>
                    
                    In March 2022, the SIAM Chapter
                    teamed together with the AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics)
                    Chapter, to host their first joint event: Women in STEM. In light of
                    International Women's Day, the event honored and celebrated
                    women in STEM from various levels, ranging from professionals in the field,
                    including UB Faculty, Alumni, and Graduate Students. Each of them had the
                    opportunity to give a first account of what it has been like to be a woman
                    in STEM, in their respective fields and levels.<br><br>
                    
                    We invite everyone who supports the purpose of SIAM to become a member of
                    the Chapter and attend our future events. We emphasize that the Chapter is
                    open to both graduate and undergraduate students in fields using applied
                    mathematics. Chapter members can obtain free SIAM membership, as well as
                    they can join for free two activity groups, related to their majors, through
                    SIAM.<br><br> -->

                    <!-- <b style = "color:red">
                        We should link to AWM's UB site.  Perhaps for each event, we could hyperlink to pictures
                        from the event if we have any.  If we don't have many pictures for these events, I can put
                        the pictures side-by-side to the paragraph description.
